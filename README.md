# Development-and-Biodiversity---Squamish

# Question : How do changes in the number of granted building permits affect biodiversity in Squamish?

# This project aims to understand the relationship between some aspects of economic development (building permits) 
# and the state of biodiversity (richness and abundance using the Shannon index) in Squamish. 

# The measure of the corelation between building and biodiversity will be made via mapping different data sets, 
# determing quadrats, and calcualting biodiversity and building permits in each quadrat.
