Welcome to the Development-and-Biodiversity---Squamish wiki!

Project question : What is the correlation between the number of building permits and biodiversity in Squamish?

This project aims to understand the relationship between some aspects of economic development and urbanization (i.e.building permits) and the state of biodiversity (richness and abundance using the Shannon index) in Squamish.

In this project I use data from iNaturalist (directly accessed via the the rinat package) and public data about the number of building permits granted in 2021 in the district of Squamish. I will explore how to use spatial data to 1) provide an intuitive sense of distribution and density; 2) determine quadrants allowing to collect the data necessary to run correlation analyses.

So far I have build the code using data for amphibians only. The inclusion of all other taxa will happen soon, therefore allowing for the calculation of biodiversity using the Shannon index.

The measure of the correlation between building permits and biodiversity will be made using a Pearson's correlation coefficient.
